## Contributing

I will likely not accept merge requests until the the project is complete. You can track progress [here](https://github.com/SegFault-Verm/Ver).

Install ESLint globally and follow the ESLint rules or your MR will not be accepted.

You can add bug reports and feature requests [here](https://github.com/SegFault-Verm/Ver/issues), but I will only be focusing on features that directly relate to existing tickets on the project tracker above until I am finished with the project.
